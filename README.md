**Project closed on 31/03/2016**

The project was developed by a group of students enrolled at the faculty of Computer Engineering at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. The application facilitates access to captive Network University, it allows access to the network without having to enter everytime a username and password.

The application has been developed for iOS and Android.<br>
This repository contains only the code written by me for the iOS application.
